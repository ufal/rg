# UFAL RG in 2014

**The main topic of the reading group is Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.**

If you are interested sign up to our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ufal-rg), or sign up by sending an empty e-mail to `ufal-rg+subscribe@googlegroups.com`.

Join our discussion community at [Google+](https://plus.google.com/communities/108489284892037016985).

**Regular meetings take place on Mondays at 16:00 in front of the room 424 at Malostranske namesti 25 in Prague**
